<section class="font-body text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-400">
<p>This is going to be an interesting episode because this one is about Kenya. And Kenyan coffee is renowned for its acidity. And acidity, as some of you may know, if you've been listening to the last couple of episodes, is something that I struggle with when drinking coffee.</p>
<p>This particular coffee is from Kamwangi. And Kamwangi is one of two factories by a Kenyan cooperative which I cannot pronounce, so please bear with me and follow the links in the show notes. This year Sample purchased two lots from the Kamwangi factory, one AA and the other AB. These are two gradings used to sort and sell coffee. This particular lot is a AA grade, which is the second largest grading by size after elephant beans. And this is graded using a 7.22 millimeter screen. And this grade tends to fetch the highest prices.</p>
<p>The Kamwangi factory was established in 1983. And it's 800 member farmers ... which I think actually now is closing in on 1,000. I could be wrong ... grow SL28 and SL34 varietals, alongside Ruiru 11; which is probably not how you pronounce that varietal. I have no idea. And that is a typical mix for a high quality coffee from Kenya.</p>
<p>Coffee from this factory is grown in volcanic soil. Volcanic soil is something I talked about in the first episode when I was talking about the Guatemalan coffee farm run by Francisco Martinez. While terroir is crucial ... that is soil, climate and elevation ... terroir alone doesn't ensure excellent coffee in the cup. I thought that terroir was more important than it actually is.</p>
<p>The more reading I do about specialty coffee, it's become apparent that processing is probably more important, and thankfully Kamwangi is one of the best at processing in Kenya. You could have the best soil, you could have the best climate, and you could be farming at the perfect elevation, and then if the processing falls apart after all of that hard work then it was all for naught.</p>
<p>One subject we do touch on, on Light Roast, is varietals and coffee varieties. And sometimes I don't think we dig deep enough into this area. And if this is boring on any level, please let me know.</p>
<p>So what makes up the coffee that comes from the Kamwangi factory that Sample have roasted really, really well? So in this special little bag we have Ruiru 11. Ruiru 11 is a compact high yielding variety developed in Kenya to allow for more intensive coffee production and fewer losses from diseases and pests. This particular varietal is super popular in Kenya, and I think that it's probably going to be even more popular as time goes on purely because of its resilience.</p>
<p>So in the late '60s, coffee berry disease was a massive problem in Kenya. It led to a loss of around 50% of Kenya's production. That in itself is a coffee crisis, right? So in the '70s, the Coffee Research Station at Ruiru ... which gives Ruiru 11 its name ... began an intensive breeding program for varieties that were immune to CBD. This led to the development of Ruiru 11, which was released in the mid '80s.</p>
<p>The two varietals that are super popular in Kenya, SL28 and SL34, which were developed by Scott Labs in the '30s, are very common coffees to get from Kenya and are very well-known for being unbelievable. The issue is, these two varietals are susceptible to coffee disease. That's where Ruiru 11 has really come into the picture.</p>
<p>One interesting fact about SL28 is that it's notable for its rusticity, a quality meaning that it can be left untended for years or even decades at a time and then return to successful production. There are SL28 trees in many parts of Kenya that are 60 to 80 years old and are still productive.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this episode I mentioned that I tend to have trouble drinking coffee that's highly acidic. My understanding at least, is that Kenyan coffee tends to be quite bright. And in my experience, it is. So the onus really is on the roaster to control that brightness during the roasting process.</p>
<p>For anyone that has picked up this batch from Sample, you'll note that Sample have rated the acidity of this coffee as high. However, in my experience, as I have dialled in my preferred grind, temperature and brew time, with an AeroPress, super bright coffee hasn't been a problem due to the brewing method in the house. I can report that the vibrancy is definitely still there. That's undeniable. But it's also very smooth.</p>
<p>As I was doing research into acidity, and acidity in so far as brewing with an AeroPress, it was noted that the AeroPress does control the amount of acidity in the cup. Overall, I was a little worried because, as I said, I've had a rough history with Kenyan coffee. But I should have known better. I should have known better because Sample know how to roast.</p>
