<p>The idea behind this page is to share my current brewing methodology and the equipment I use to get there. If you have been listening to Light Roast for any length of time you would be aware that I brew exclusively with the <a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://aeropress.com/">AeroPress</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen an AeroPress in the wild I would be very surprised.</p>
<p><a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://samplecoffee.com.au/shop/aeropress">Aussies you can pick on up from Sample</a>. Anywhere else, a quick Google search will  be all you need to find a supplier near you.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-display text-white">AeroPress Recipe</h3>
<p>The thing that makes the AeroPress coffee brewer such a delight is that you can brew coffee in a multitude of different ways with it. For a deep dive on YouTube, check out the <a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxz0FjZMVOl2858ytsWi9DH8NUKAz4nvl">James Hoffman AeroPress series</a> that he recently did. It’s a great series even though I tend to veer away from James slightly in terms of my approach.</p>
<p>This is my current recipe:</p>
<ol class="ml-4 font-body list-disc text-white">
	<li>Inverted AeroPress method</li>
	<li>Brew at 94 °C</li>
	<li>12g to 200 ml coffee to water ratio</li>
	<li>Steep for 1:30</li>
	<li>Press for 20 seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>This may change over time but at the moment I am relatively happy with this. I always brew with lightly roasted beans — darker roasts may require a coarser grind.</p>
<p>I grind my beans with the <a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://comandantegrinder.com/">Comandante C-40</a> and tend to leave this set to 18 clicks from zero. This tends to produce an almost espresso grind with this particular grinder. For filtration, I have had consistent results in my cup when using the <a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://samplecoffee.com.au/shop/aeropress-able-metal-filter-disc-fine">Able Brewing Fine Disk filter</a> rather than the included paper filters for sustainability reasons and cost.</p>
<p>Coffee scales are a must. I am currently using the <a class="text-white border-b border-gray-300 hover:border-b border-gray-400 hover:border-gray-100" href="https://samplecoffee.com.au/shop/hario-v60-drip-scales">Hario V60 scales</a> with my AeroPress but almost any scales will do.</p>
